# PulseSphere — Mini Social Media Platform
### CodeAlpha Full Stack Web Development Internship — Task 2

PulseSphere is a complete, modern, and lightweight social media platform built to satisfy **Task 2 of the CodeAlpha Internship guidelines**. It features responsive Single Page Application (SPA) architecture, JWT authentication with salted bcrypt password hashing, dynamic relational likes and follows, interactive comments, and an out-of-the-box zero-configuration SQLite database.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. User Authentication & Profile Management
- **Registration & Login**: Secure account registration with email/username uniqueness checks and bcrypt password hashing.
- **JWT Session Tokens**: Persistent state management via secure token storage and Authorization headers.
- **Dedicated User Profiles**:
  - Displays user avatar, full name, username, bio, and joined date.
  - Real-time stat counters: **Posts**, **Followers**, and **Following**.
  - User can edit their full name, avatar URL, and bio description.
  - Tabular feed of individual posts created by the specific user.

### 2. Posts & Interactive Comments
- **Rich Post Creation**: Text-based posts supporting hashtags, line breaks, and optional image URL attachments with real-time preview and character counter.
- **Feed Filtering**:
  - **For You**: Global feed of community updates.
  - **Following**: Dynamic personalized feed containing updates exclusively from creators you follow.
  - **Live Search**: Instant keyword search for posts and creators.
- **Interactive Comment System**: Any authenticated user can expand the comment thread under any post and submit real-time comments. Comments display author details and timestamps. Post and comment owners can manage and delete comments.

### 3. Dynamic Relational Like & Follow System
- **Relational Like System**: Relational `likes` table with composite uniqueness (`post_id`, `user_id`). Liking a post toggles dynamically via AJAX/Fetch API with heart pulse animation and live counter updates.
- **Relational Follower/Following**: Dedicated `follows` relational table (`follower_id`, `following_id`). Users can follow/unfollow creators from their profile page or from the "Suggested People" sidebar widget.
- **Dynamic Counters**: Following or liking updates counts instantly across the UI without full page reloads.
